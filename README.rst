Introduction
------------

``vim-mythryl`` provides:
        - Mythryl syntax highlighting for ``*.pkg`` and ``*.api`` files,
        - Mythryl script-oriented syntax highlighting for files that begin with 
          the shebang line (``#!.*\<mythryl\>``), and
        - **(deprecated)** Mythryl's ``make6`` syntax highlighting for 
          ``*.make6`` files [*]_ .
        - snipMate__ support for Mythryl.

.. [*] I have also included the match for ``*.standard`` files to be ``make6`` files, since I have seen files with such a suffix and they look like ``make6`` files.
