Introduction
------------

``vim-mythryl`` aims to provide:
        - Mythryl syntax highlighting for ``*.pkg`` and ``*.api`` files,
        - Mythryl script-oriented syntax highlighting for files that begin with 
          the shebang line (``#!.*\<mythryl\>``),
        - auto-indent support for Mythryl,
        - **(deprecated)** Mythryl's ``make6`` syntax highlighting for 
          ``*.make6`` files [*]_ , and
        - snipMate__ support for Mythryl.

.. [*] I have also included the match for ``*.standard`` files to be ``make6`` files, since I have seen files with such a suffix and they look like ``make6`` files.

Installation
------------

Just copy ``{ftplugin,indent,snippets,syntax}/*.vim`` and 
``ftdetect/mythryl.vim`` to ``~/.vim/``::

        $ cd vim-mythryl
        $ ls
        COPYING  ftdetect/  ftplugin/  indent/  README.rst  snippets/  syntax/
        $ cp -rut ~/.vim ftdetect/  ftplugin/  indent/  snippets/  syntax/
 


TODO
----

* Implement indent rules for Mythryl according to the `Coding Conventions <http://mythryl.org/my-Preface-11.html>`_
        - Indentation_  (case- & if-statements: DONE.  Tuples: DONE.  Records: DONE.)
        - `Line stuff up`_ (equal sign: DONE.  Fun: UNTESTED.)
        - `Case expressions`_ (buggy)
        - `Record expressions`_ (short form: OK.  Long form: unimplemented.)
        - `Except statements`_ (unimplemented)
        - `Function definitions`_ (partial)
        - `If statements`_ (DONE.  functionality provided by snipMate)
        - `?? ::`_ (unimplemented)
* **(deprecated)** Create indent file for ``make6``.
* Support the remaining syntax classes:
        - `regular expression escape characters`_
* Keep the syntax files clean and readable.
